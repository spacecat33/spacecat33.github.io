You shouldn't learn to code alone. Well, not if you want to have a life and to stay somewhat sane.

Putting yourself through hell for hours trying to pass a test long after you consulted google and the lab instructions for the 100th time with no luck is nothing short of horrendous. 

If you have experienced this then you know that if you had any motivation to code before that Lab. Consider it all lost. This is not the pain before the gain stage. No. What you are experiencing is unnecessary pain. 

Yes! You can learn to code independently.

Yes! You need to learn how to resolve errors and debug. But within reason. 

Healthy progress cannot be made alone. 

There are courses other than coding where well-written books, research tools and e-learning videos could enable a student to successfully complete them without ever consulting another student or even a tutor.

Coding however is a different kind of course for a new learner. 

Very different. 

The sooner you realise this fact, the faster you will progress through this course.

"A coder needs to have the ability to figure out things on their own", the Flatiron School so often repeats. That's true.

However, at the beginning, when you are starting to learn, in order to succeed at learning to code, you can't do it alone.

You need to know when to ask for help and to, in fact, ask for that help. Don't worry about what the reaction will be to your question. It's a waste of time to worry about that. 

However, being found staring at your computer screen, pulling your hair out is something to worry about after you truly have done your best and tried but are still stuck. Now THAT is definitely a waste of time.  

Just. Don't. Sit. There.

In tears...

DO. ASK. For. Help.

So take a deep breath. Ask A Question. Make progress!

Be kind to yourself. It's not cheating. The TCs don't give you the answers anyway, they help you work it out on your own. 

So much better than working it out on your own ALL ALONE.

Feel better?

Good.
